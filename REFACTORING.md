# Dashboard Refactoring Documentation

## Overview
The dashboard page has been refactored to improve maintainability, readability, and code organization. The original monolithic component has been broken down into smaller, reusable components and custom hooks.

## Key Improvements

### 1. **Component Separation**
- **PlanCard**: Handles subscription plan display and management
- **ApiKeysTable**: Manages the API keys table with all its functionality
- **ApiKeyModal**: Handles the create/edit API key modal
- **ApiKeyRow**: Individual table row component with memoization

### 2. **Custom Hooks**
- **useApiKeyForm**: Manages form state, validation, and submission
- **useModal**: Generic modal state management
- **useToast**: Toast notification management
- **useConfirmModal**: Confirmation modal state management
- **useApiKeyActions**: API key specific actions (create, update, delete, copy)

### 3. **Type Safety**
- Added TypeScript interfaces in `types/dashboard.ts`
- Proper type annotations throughout the codebase
- Better IntelliSense and compile-time error checking

### 4. **Performance Optimizations**
- Used `React.memo` for components to prevent unnecessary re-renders
- `useCallback` for event handlers to maintain referential equality
- Memoized expensive operations

### 5. **Error Handling**
- Centralized error handling in custom hooks
- Better user feedback with toast notifications
- Proper error boundaries and validation

### 6. **Code Organization**
- Separated concerns (UI, business logic, state management)
- Reusable utility functions
- Clean separation between components and hooks

## File Structure

```
components/
  dashboard/
    ├── PlanCard.tsx          # Subscription plan display
    ├── ApiKeysTable.tsx      # API keys table
    └── ApiKeyModal.tsx       # Create/edit modal

hooks/
  ├── useApiKeyForm.ts        # Form management
  ├── useModal.ts             # Modal state
  ├── useToast.ts             # Toast notifications
  ├── useConfirmModal.ts      # Confirmation modals
  └── useApiKeyActions.ts     # API key operations

types/
  └── dashboard.ts            # TypeScript interfaces

utils/
  └── apiKeyGenerator.ts      # Utility functions

app/
  tableau-de-bord/
    └── page.tsx              # Main dashboard component
```

## Benefits

1. **Maintainability**: Each component has a single responsibility
2. **Reusability**: Components and hooks can be reused across the application
3. **Testability**: Smaller units are easier to test in isolation
4. **Readability**: Code is more organized and easier to understand
5. **Performance**: Optimized re-renders and memoization
6. **Type Safety**: Better development experience with TypeScript

## Migration Notes

- The main dashboard component is now much cleaner and focused on orchestration
- All business logic has been moved to custom hooks
- UI components are now reusable and can be easily styled or modified
- Error handling is more consistent across the application
- The codebase follows React best practices and modern patterns

## Future Improvements

1. Add unit tests for components and hooks
2. Implement error boundaries for better error handling
3. Add loading states for better UX
4. Consider implementing a state management solution (Zustand/Redux) for complex state
5. Add accessibility improvements (ARIA labels, keyboard navigation)
6. Implement virtual scrolling for large API key lists
